# MexiBunny
A game about hungry and angry bunny collecting burritos, fighting deadly bananas, hating them as I do, with carrot
(which I also hate) nunchakus.

Project has been built and written using default CLion MinGW Toolchain, SDL2 2.6.3, SDL2 mixer 2.26.4 and SDL_image 
2.6.3.

Everything except background and music is made entirely by me.

Controls:<br/>
A or Left arrow - go left<br/>
D or Right arrow - go right<br/>
Space - jump<br/>
Shift - hit with nunchakus<br/><br/>

In case if you didn't have libraries (to compile project) or just want to play a game without compiling it, I placed 
zip files, inside zip_files directory with libraries and whole game ready for start, just unzip it and open 
mexibunny.exe.

Remember to add SDL2.dll, SDL2_image.dll and SDL2_mixer.dll to folder which is creating during build of project.

Enjoy :)

This is my college project, but it will be continued afterward and potentially released or refactored for Unity or 
Unreal Engine and released on digital platform.
